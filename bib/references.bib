  abstract  = {Current techniques for characterizing cybersickness in virtual environments rely on qualitative questionnaires. This paper acquires EEG signals from participants experiencing vection-induced cybersickness and compares those signals to a baseline. The study finds a correlation between the participant-reported cybersickness and brain EEG signals, highlighting the potential for interactive measures to mitigate cybersickness.},

  abstract  = {The present article explores the most popular approaches and the best practices for the design and implementation of cognitive gaming interventions that combine Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems with Virtual Reality (VR). We focus on interventions that target cognitive skills related to perception, visuospatial attention and visuospatial memory. To this purpose, we review the techniques and algorithms that are commonly used for data pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification in such interventions. We discuss issues related to BCI-VR Cognitive Gaming, including the BCI paradigms, the action tasks and environments, user characteristics, algorithms, channels, accuracy, and the most prominent findings. We conclude with a discussion of the current challenges, limitations, future research directions, and the potential commercial applications of BCI-VR in cognitive gaming.},

Numerous studies have focused on analyzing the cognitive aspects involved in game playing that could help in providing an optimal gaming experience by improving video game design. This paper presents a framework for classifying the game player’s expertise level using wearable electroencephalography (EEG) headset. We hypothesize that expert and novice players' brain activity is different, which can be classified using frequency domain features extracted from EEG signals of the game player.},

Therefore, a new type of rehabilitation technology with more active participation combining brain–computer interface (BCI) with virtual reality (VR) has developed rapidly in recent years and has been used in rehabilitation in neurological diseases. This narrative review analyzed and characterized the development and application of the new training system (BCI-VR) in rehabilitation of neurological diseases from the perspective of the BCI paradigm, to provide a pathway for future research in this field.},

This study explores the cortical adaptation and dynamics of cortical involvement in human upright walking with a closed-loop BCI in a virtual environment. Delta band EEG (0.1 – 3 Hz) was used as the main feature in prediction. Results demonstrate the feasibility of using a closed-loop BCI to learn to control a walking avatar, with significant improvements in decoding accuracies and differences in cortical network activity between walking with and without BCI control.},
