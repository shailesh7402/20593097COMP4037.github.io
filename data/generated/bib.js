        "abstract": "The present article explores the most popular approaches and the best practices for the design and implementation of cognitive gaming interventions that combine Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems with Virtual Reality (VR). We focus on interventions that target cognitive skills related to perception, visuospatial attention and visuospatial memory. To this purpose, we review the techniques and algorithms that are commonly used for data pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification in such interventions. We discuss issues related to BCI-VR Cognitive Gaming, including the BCI paradigms, the action tasks and environments, user characteristics, algorithms, channels, accuracy, and the most prominent findings. We conclude with a discussion of the current challenges, limitations, future research directions, and the potential commercial applications of BCI-VR in cognitive gaming.",

Numerous studies have focused on analyzing the cognitive aspects involved in game playing that could help in providing an optimal gaming experience by improving video game design. This paper presents a framework for classifying the game player\u2019s expertise level using wearable electroencephalography (EEG) headset. We hypothesize that expert and novice players' brain activity is different, which can be classified using frequency domain features extracted from EEG signals of the game player.",
